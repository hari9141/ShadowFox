                    <p>
                        At Sakthi Dental Clinic, we offer advanced, non-surgical gum care using modern LASER
                        technology for precise and effective treatment. Whether you're dealing with early signs of gum
                        disease or a more advanced condition, our skilled professionals ensure thorough cleaning to
                        restore gum health. Scaling is advised for moderate cases to remove plaque and tartar buildup,
                        while more severe periodontal issues may require deep cleaning procedures like root planing,
                        supported by LASER treatment.

                        Whether tooth damage is caused by cavities, trauma, or wear from habits like teeth grinding or
                        nail-biting, our team uses high-quality materials and the latest techniques to repair and
                        protect
                        your teeth. We focus on sealing gaps effectively to prevent future decay.

                        before recommending removal, but when necessary, we perform extractions using gentle
                        techniques to minimize discomfort.

                        the jawbone, creating a stable foundation for prosthetic teeth.

                        For advanced gum disease, flap surgery may be necessary. Our skilled team at Sakthi Dental
                        Clinic performs this procedure by lifting the gum tissue to remove deep-seated plaque and
                        bacteria, then repositioning it for optimal healing. This treatment helps prevent further
                        periodontal issues and supports gum health.

                        <p>Not entirely. While medications may offer short-term relief, long-lasting relief requires
                            identifying and treating the root cause of the pain through professional dental care.</p>

                        teeth?</button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>No. Scaling safely removes plaque and tartar from teeth and below the gum line. It doesn’t
                            damage enamel or create gaps. Some temporary sensitivity may occur, but it usually subsides
                            as gums heal and reattach to the teeth.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Scaling can remove surface (extrinsic) stains but not fluorosis, which is an internal
                            (intrinsic) stain. Fluorosis may require treatments like bleaching, veneers, or crowns for
                            cosmetic improvement.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Not always. If the cavity has reached the pulp—the innermost layer of the tooth—simple
                            filling won’t help. In such cases, root canal treatment or tooth extraction might be
                            necessary. Fillings are effective only when the damage is limited to the outer layers
                            (enamel and dentin).</p>

                        (RCT)?</button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes. A crown is recommended after RCT to protect the treated tooth, which may be weaker due
                            to decay. It prevents fractures and adds durability, especially during chewing.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes. If a milk tooth has a deep cavity and is likely to remain in the mouth for some time, an
                            RCT can preserve it and prevent infection or early loss.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Brush your teeth twice daily with proper technique, rinse after meals, floss regularly, and
                            schedule routine check-ups with your dentist to maintain healthy teeth and gums.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Braces are most effective between ages 12 and 14, when the jaw and teeth are still
                            developing. However, some cases may benefit from earlier intervention depending on the
                            condition.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>No. Wisdom teeth only require removal if they are impacted, infected, or causing pain due to
                            crowding or damage to adjacent teeth.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes. Replacing extracted teeth helps maintain proper bite alignment and prevents adjacent
                            teeth from shifting, which can affect chewing and overall oral function.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Dental implants restore both the appearance and functionality of missing teeth. They provide
                            a stable, natural-looking solution that can improve confidence and overall quality of life.

                        <p>Use a soft or medium-bristled toothbrush with a small head for better reach. Choose a
                            non-abrasive fluoride toothpaste and replace your toothbrush every three months for optimal

                        <p>Tooth sensitivity can result from enamel wear (due to attrition or abrasion), tooth decay,
